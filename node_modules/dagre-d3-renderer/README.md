# dagre-d3-renderer - A D3-based renderer for dagre

This project is an out-of-box replacement for [dagre-d3](https://github.com/dagrejs/dagre-d3).

This project isn't built from scratch. It's based on the original [dagre-d3](https://github.com/dagrejs/dagre-d3) project.

[Dagre](https://github.com/dagrejs/dagre) is a JavaScript library that makes it easy to lay out directed graphs on the client-side. The dagre-d3 library acts as a front-end to dagre, providing actual rendering using [D3](http://d3js.org).

For more details, including examples and configuration options, please see our [wiki](https://github.com/dagrejs/dagre-d3/wiki).
